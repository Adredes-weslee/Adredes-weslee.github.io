## Project Overview

This project delivers a **Custom RAG Engine**, a sophisticated local-first Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed for secure, enterprise-grade Question Answering over diverse internal documentation. Built specifically for **local deployment**, it processes GitLab repository data including Python code and Jupyter notebooks, leveraging self-hosted open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) via Ollama to provide accurate, context-aware answers with complete data privacy. Key features include GPU-accelerated processing, hybrid code-aware embeddings, intelligent LLM enhancement, and multi-model evaluation - all running entirely on your hardware.

## The Challenge: Unlocking Enterprise Code Knowledge Securely

Enterprises and educational institutions possess vast amounts of technical knowledge embedded in code repositories, project documentation, and learning materials. Making this information easily accessible while maintaining absolute data privacy and security is a critical challenge. This RAG engine was developed to address:

1. **Code Understanding Barriers**: Difficulty in finding relevant implementation patterns and learning from existing codebases.
2. **Educational Data Privacy**: Need for completely local processing of student projects and sensitive learning materials.
3. **Diverse Technical Formats**: Handling Python scripts, Jupyter notebooks, and documentation within a unified system.
4. **Performance Requirements**: Need for fast processing and retrieval using available hardware (GPU acceleration).
5. **Zero External Dependencies**: Avoiding any external API calls or data transmission for maximum security.
6. **Local Resource Optimization**: Efficiently utilizing available GPU/CPU resources for maximum performance.

## Solution: A Local-First, GPU-Accelerated RAG Architecture

The RAG Engine employs a sophisticated, hardware-optimized architecture designed exclusively for local deployment:

## Technical Implementation Highlights

### 1. GPU-Accelerated Data Ingestion with LLM Enhancement
The system processes GitLab repository data with intelligent content enhancement:

```python
# Enhanced data processing pipeline (from data_ingestion.py)
def process_repository_data():
    # Discover Python and notebook files across 23 people
    files = discover_gitlab_files(root_directory)
    
    # GPU-accelerated processing
    for file_path, content in files:
        if is_python_file(file_path):
            # LLM enhancement with local Ollama
            enhanced_content = enhance_code_with_llm(content, llm_model)
            
            # Code-aware embeddings
            embeddings = generate_code_embeddings(enhanced_content, graphcodebert_model)
            code_faiss_index.add_with_metadata(embeddings, metadata)
            
        elif is_notebook_file(file_path):
            # Process notebook cells
            enhanced_content = enhance_notebook_with_llm(content, llm_model)
            
            # Semantic embeddings
            embeddings = generate_text_embeddings(enhanced_content, minilm_model)
            notebook_faiss_index.add_with_metadata(embeddings, metadata)
```

### 2. Local Multi-Model Architecture with Evaluation
Environment-aware model selection with built-in evaluation:

```python
# Local model configuration (from model_config.py)
def get_local_models():
    environment = detect_environment()  # local_high, local_standard, local_minimal
    
    if environment == "local_high":
        return {
            'primary': ChatOllama(model="llama3.2:3b", temperature=0.1),
            'judge': ChatOllama(model="llama3.1:8b", temperature=0.0),
            'fallback': ChatOllama(model="llama3.2:1b", temperature=0.2)
        }
    # ... other configurations

# Query processing with evaluation (from rag_chain.py)
def process_query_with_evaluation(query, models):
    # Generate initial response
    response = models['primary'].invoke(context + query)
    
    # Judge evaluation
    evaluation = models['judge'].invoke(f"Evaluate this response: {response}")
    score = extract_score(evaluation)
    
    # Fallback if needed
    if score < 0.7:
        response = models['fallback'].invoke(context + query)
    
    return response, evaluation, score
```

### 3. Hardware-Optimized Local Deployment
Complete local setup with automatic optimization:

```python
# System optimization (from check.py and model_loader.py)
def optimize_for_hardware():
    # GPU detection and optimization
    if torch.cuda.is_available():
        device = "cuda"
        # Use GPU-accelerated FAISS
        faiss_index = faiss.IndexFlatIP(embedding_dim)
        faiss_index = faiss.index_cpu_to_gpu(res, 0, faiss_index)
    else:
        device = "cpu"
        # CPU-optimized FAISS
        faiss_index = faiss.IndexFlatIP(embedding_dim)
    
    return device, faiss_index
```

## Local Deployment Architecture

The system is designed exclusively for local deployment with sharing options:

### Primary Deployment (Local Streamlit):
```bash
# Complete local setup process
# 1. Install Ollama and download models
ollama pull llama3.2:3b
ollama pull llama3.1:8b
ollama pull llama3.2:1b

# 2. Start Ollama server
ollama serve  # Runs on localhost:11434

# 3. Process data with GPU acceleration
python run_data_ingestion.py --full

# 4. Launch Streamlit interface
streamlit run src/main.py  # Available at localhost:8501
```

### Sharing Options:
```bash
# Option 1: Ngrok tunnel for secure sharing
ngrok http 8501  # Creates public tunnel to local app

# Option 2: VPS deployment with same architecture
