## Background: The Strategic Imperative of Wet-Bulb Temperature

**Singapore's Climate Challenge: Beyond Temperature Headlines**

While media reports focus on dry-bulb temperature, **wet-bulb temperature provides the complete picture of human heat tolerance**. In Singapore's high-humidity environment, this distinction becomes critical for public health and economic productivity.

### üö® **Critical Heat Stress Thresholds**
| WBT Range | Health Impact | Economic Implications | Population at Risk |
|-----------|---------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **> 28¬∞C** | Vulnerable populations at risk | Reduced outdoor productivity | Elderly, children, outdoor workers |
| **> 31¬∞C** | Physical labor becomes dangerous | Major economic disruption | All outdoor workers |
| **> 35¬∞C** | **Theoretical limit of human survival** | **Total outdoor activity cessation** | **Entire population** |

### üìà **Singapore's Current Risk Profile (1982-2023 Analysis)**
* **Current Range:** 23.1¬∞C to 28.9¬∞C (approaching dangerous thresholds)
* **Temperature Trend:** Mean air temperature correlation (r = 0.89) with WBT
* **Humidity Paradox:** Higher humidity periods show *lower* WBT due to cloud cover effects
* **GHG Impact:** All greenhouse gases show positive correlations with rising WBT

**Policy Context:** With Minister Grace Fu's projection of 40¬∞C peak temperatures by 2045, understanding WBT becomes essential for maintaining Singapore's livability and economic competitiveness.

## Technical Implementation Snapshot

While the focus of this page is policy, the analysis was underpinned by data science techniques. For instance, Stull's formula (2011) can be used to calculate WBT from temperature and humidity:

```python
# Sample code for wet-bulb temperature calculation using Stull's formula
import numpy as np

def calculate_wetbulb_stull(temperature, relative_humidity):
¬† ¬† """
¬† ¬† Calculate wet-bulb temperature using Stull's formula (2011).
¬† ¬† temperature: dry-bulb temperature (¬∞C)
¬† ¬† relative_humidity: relative humidity (%)
¬† ¬† """
¬† ¬† tw = temperature * np.arctan(0.151977 * np.power(relative_humidity + 8.313659, 0.5)) + \
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†np.arctan(temperature + relative_humidity) - \
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†np.arctan(relative_humidity - 1.676331) + \
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†0.00391838 * np.power(relative_humidity, 1.5) * np.arctan(0.023101 * relative_humidity) - \
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†4.686035
