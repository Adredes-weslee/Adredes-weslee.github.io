## Project Overview

Developed a predictive model for wet-bulb temperature estimation using machine learning techniques and climate data. The project aims to help identify regions at risk of dangerous heat stress conditions by analyzing historical weather patterns and climate change projections.

## Background & Significance

Wet-bulb temperature (TW) combines heat and humidity into a single value measuring heat stress on the human body. At wet-bulb temperatures above 35°C, even healthy humans cannot survive extended exposure as the body cannot cool itself through sweating.

With climate change accelerating, identifying regions approaching critical wet-bulb thresholds has significant public health implications:

- At TW > 31°C: Most physical labor becomes dangerous
- At TW > 35°C: Even resting humans cannot thermoregulate effectively

This project contributes to climate resilience by providing data-driven forecasts of when and where dangerous heat stress conditions might emerge.

## Methodology

### Data Sources
- World Bank Climate Change Knowledge Portal (40+ years of historical data)
- ERA5 reanalysis dataset from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts
- Local meteorological station readings from high-risk regions (South Asia, Persian Gulf)

### Data Processing
- Extracted and harmonized temperature, humidity, pressure, and wind data across sources
- Applied quality control filters to identify and handle anomalous readings
- Calculated historical wet-bulb temperatures using Stull's formula and psychrometric equations
- Aligned spatial data using Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques

### Model Development
The model employed a two-stage approach:

1. **Regional-Temporal Classification**:
   - Random Forest classifier to identify potential heat stress regions and seasons
   - Area Under ROC = 0.89 for identifying high-risk zones

2. **Wet-bulb Temperature Prediction**:
   - Gradient Boosting Regressor trained on historical climate data
   - RMSE = 0.72°C compared to psychrometric equations
   - Fine-tuned through 5-fold cross-validation

## Results & Findings

The project successfully built a predictive model with key findings:

1. **Current Risk Assessment**:
   - Identified three primary global regions that routinely experience wet-bulb temperatures above 30°C
   - Persian Gulf, South Asia (Northern India, Pakistan, Bangladesh), and parts of Southeast Asia

2. **Future Projections**:
   - Under RCP 8.5 scenario (high emissions), the model projects expanding risk zones where:
     - 31°C wet-bulb events increase from 1% to 4.4% of summer days by 2050
     - Risk zones expand to include southern Europe, central China, and eastern United States

3. **Seasonal Analysis**:
   - Critical wet-bulb events show increased frequency and duration
   - The average dangerous heat wave duration projected to increase by 73% by 2050

4. **Validation Against Historical Events**:
   - Model accuracy verified against recorded heat waves from 1995-2020
   - Correctly identified 92% of documented extreme heat events where heat-related fatalities occurred
