## Project Overview

This project developed a sophisticated **binary sentiment classifier** for YouTube comments, analyzing over 63,000 comments to accurately distinguish between positive and negative sentiment. By employing a novel **hybrid labeling approach** (combining VADER, Flair, and HuggingFace Transformers) and leveraging advanced NLP techniques including model stacking, the system provides content creators and digital marketers with a powerful tool to understand audience reception, manage online reputation, and optimize content strategy. The final stacked model achieved an **accuracy of 87%** and a weighted F1-score of 0.87.

## The Business Need: Navigating the Noise of Online Feedback

For YouTube content creators, brands, and public figures (like Justin Bieber, whose comment data was initially explored), understanding audience sentiment is crucial but challenging due to the sheer volume and informal nature of comments. This project addresses key needs:

1.  **Reputation Management:** Rapidly identifying spikes in negative sentiment that could signal emerging PR issues or audience dissatisfaction.
2.  **Content Strategy Optimization:** Gaining insights into which video topics, segments, or styles resonate positively or negatively with the audience.
3.  **Community Moderation & Health:** Flagging potentially toxic or harmful comments for review, fostering a more positive community environment.
4.  **Audience Engagement Analysis:** Correlating sentiment patterns with other engagement metrics (views, likes, shares, watch time) to understand what drives positive interaction.
5.  **Trend Identification:** Tracking how sentiment evolves over time for a video, across a channel, or in response to specific events.

Manually sifting through thousands of comments is impractical, making an automated sentiment analysis solution highly valuable.

## Methodology: A Multi-Stage NLP Pipeline

The project followed a comprehensive NLP pipeline:

### 1. Data Collection & Preprocessing
-   **Data Source:** Over 63,000 YouTube comments were collected using the YouTube Data API from a diverse set of videos.
-   **Specialized Preprocessing:** A custom pipeline was developed to handle the unique characteristics of social media text, including:
    -   Lowercase conversion, contraction expansion.
    -   Emoji demojization (converting emojis to text representations like `:face_with_tears_of_joy:`).
    -   Removal of URLs, HTML tags, user mentions.
    -   Tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization (using NLTK).

### 2. Innovative Hybrid Labeling Strategy
To create a reliable training dataset without extensive manual labeling, a consensus-based approach was adopted using three different sentiment analysis tools:
-   **VADER:** A lexicon and rule-based tool tuned for social media.
-   **Flair NLP:** A framework using contextual string embeddings.
-   **HuggingFace Transformers:** A DistilBERT-based model fine-tuned for sentiment.
A comment was labeled as 'positive' or 'negative' for the training set only if at least two of these three models agreed on the sentiment, filtering out ambiguous or neutral comments for the binary classification task.

### 3. Feature Engineering
Multiple techniques were used to convert processed text into numerical features for machine learning models:
-   **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency):** Using unigrams and bigrams to capture word importance.
-   **Word Embeddings (Word2Vec):** Training a custom Word2Vec model on the comment corpus to generate document vectors by averaging word vectors.

### 4. Model Development and Comparison
A range of classification algorithms were trained and evaluated:
-   Logistic Regression
-   Random Forest Classifier
-   Gradient Boosting Classifier
-   Linear SVC (Support Vector Classifier)
Hyperparameters for each model were tuned using `GridSearchCV` with 5-fold cross-validation, optimizing for F1-score.

### 5. Model Stacking for Enhanced Performance
A stacked ensemble model was created by combining the predictions of the best-performing base models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) and using another Logistic Regression model as a meta-learner. This approach typically yields better performance than any single model.

## Key Results and Performance

The sentiment analysis system demonstrated strong performance:

| Model                 | Accuracy | F1-Score (Weighted Avg) | F1-Score (Negative Class) | AUC-ROC |
| --------------------- | -------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------- | ------- |
| Logistic Regression   | 0.83     | 0.83                    | ~0.66 (from blog)         | 0.91    |
| Random Forest         | 0.84     | 0.84                    | -                         | 0.93    |
| Gradient Boosting     | 0.85     | 0.85                    | -                         | 0.94    |
| Linear SVC            | 0.82     | 0.82                    | -                         | 0.90    |
| **Stacked Ensemble** | **0.87** | **0.87** | **0.83** | **0.95**|

*Note: Individual model F1-scores for the negative class varied; the stacked model showed strong balanced performance.*

**Feature Importance Analysis** (from linear models) identified key terms driving sentiment:
-   **Top Positive Indicators:** "love", "amazing", "great", "beautiful", "awesome".
-   **Top Negative Indicators:** "hate", "worst", "terrible", "bad", "poor".
The model also captured nuances like "not bad" being associated with positive sentiment.

## Sentiment Analysis Insights & Applications

The system provided valuable insights into YouTube comment dynamics:
1.  **Temporal Sentiment Shifts:** Comments posted soon after a video's upload often skewed more positive than later comments.
2.  **Comment Length Correlation:** Highly negative comments tended to be longer (average 45 words) than positive ones (average 28 words).
3.  **Engagement Link:** Videos with higher dislike-to-like ratios generally had a higher proportion of negative comments.
4.  **Topic Sensitivity:** Certain topics consistently generated more polarized (strongly positive or negative) sentiment.
5.  **Sentiment Evolution:** The overall sentiment of a comment section could evolve over the video's lifetime.

**Practical Applications for Creators & Marketers:**
-   **Automated Sentiment Dashboard:** Visualizing real-time sentiment trends for videos or entire channels.
-   **Proactive Reputation Management:** Early detection of negative sentiment spikes to address potential PR issues.
-   **Content Strategy Refinement:** Understanding audience reactions to guide future content creation and topic selection.
-   **Enhanced Community Moderation:** Automatically flagging highly negative or potentially toxic comments for human review.
-   **Comparative Analysis:** Benchmarking sentiment against competitors or previous content.

The hybrid labeling approach, using VADER, Flair, and HuggingFace Transformers, was a key component for generating reliable training data. The final sentiment classification relied on a stacked ensemble of traditional machine learning models trained on TF-IDF features.

## Conclusion & Future Directions

This project successfully developed a high-performing sentiment analysis system for YouTube comments by combining an innovative hybrid labeling strategy with robust NLP techniques and model stacking. The resulting tool offers significant value for content creators and marketers seeking to understand and manage audience sentiment effectively.

**Future Enhancements could include:**
-   **Multi-Class Sentiment & Emotion Detection:** Moving beyond binary (positive/negative) to capture a wider range of emotions (e.g., joy, anger, sadness, surprise).
-   **Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis:** Identifying sentiment towards specific aspects or topics mentioned in the comments.
-   **Sarcasm and Irony Detection:** Implementing specialized models to better handle nuanced language.
-   **Real-Time Analysis Pipeline:** Building a system for live sentiment monitoring during video premieres or live streams.
-   **Fine-tuning Transformer Models:** Customizing large language models like BERT specifically on the YouTube comment domain for potentially even higher accuracy.

By continuously refining such analytical tools, we can transform the vast, often chaotic, landscape of online comments into actionable intelligence.
