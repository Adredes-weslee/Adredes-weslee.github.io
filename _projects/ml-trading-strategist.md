## Core Features & Technical Components

### 1. Strategy Models Implemented

#### a. Manual Strategy
A baseline, rule-based strategy. It generates buy/sell signals based on predefined thresholds for multiple technical indicators (RSI, Bollinger Bands, MACD). A voting system combines these individual signals to make a final trading decision.

#### b. Tree Strategy Learner
This supervised learning model employs an ensemble of bagged random decision trees.
* **Feature Engineering**: Uses technical indicators as input features.
* **Label Generation**: Creates target labels (buy/sell/hold) based on whether future returns (e.g., 5 days ahead) exceed specified buy/sell thresholds.
* **Ensemble Method**: Utilizes bootstrap aggregation (bagging) and random feature selection within trees to improve generalization and reduce overfitting.

```python
class TreeStrategyLearner:
    def __init__(self, leaf_size=5, bags=20, boost=False, 
                 buy_threshold=0.02, sell_threshold=-0.02, prediction_days=5, verbose=False):
        self.leaf_size = leaf_size
        self.bags = bags
        # ... other initializations ...
        self.model = None # Will hold the ensemble of tree learners

    def addEvidence(self, symbol, sd, ed, sv):
        # 1. Load price data for the symbol within start date (sd) and end date (ed)
        # 2. Compute technical indicators (features) from price data
        # 3. Generate labels based on future returns and thresholds
        # 4. Create 'bags' number of decision tree learners (e.g., RTLearner)
        # 5. For each bag:
        #    a. Create a bootstrap sample of the features and labels
        #    b. Train a decision tree learner on this sample
        #    c. Store the trained learner
        # self.model now holds the ensemble of trained trees
        pass
        
    def testPolicy(self, symbol, sd, ed, sv):
        # 1. Load price data for the symbol for the test period
        # 2. Compute technical indicators (features)
        # 3. For each day in the test period:
        #    a. Get predictions from all trees in the ensemble (self.model)
        #    b. Aggregate predictions (e.g., majority vote or average)
        #    c. Convert aggregated prediction to a trading action (buy, sell, hold shares)
        # 4. Return a DataFrame of trades (date, symbol, order type, shares)
        pass
```

#### c. Q-Strategy Learner
This model applies reinforcement learning (Q-learning) to find an optimal trading policy.
* **State Representation**: Discretizes the market state based on binned values of technical indicators.
* **Q-Learning Algorithm**: Iteratively updates state-action values (Q-values) in a Q-table based on rewards received from the market environment.
* **Exploration vs. Exploitation**: Employs an epsilon-greedy policy with a decaying random action rate (rar) to balance exploring new actions and exploiting known good actions.
* **Dyna-Q**: Optionally incorporates Dyna-Q, a model-based RL technique, to perform "planning" updates using a learned model of the environment, improving sample efficiency.

```python
class QStrategyLearner:
    def __init__(self, indicator_bins=10, num_actions=3, learning_rate=0.2, 
                 discount_factor=0.9, random_action_rate=0.5,
                 random_action_decay=0.99, dyna_iterations=10, verbose=False):
        self.indicator_bins = indicator_bins # Bins per indicator for state discretization
        self.num_actions = num_actions # Typically buy, sell, hold
        self.alpha = learning_rate
        self.gamma = discount_factor
        # ... other initializations for Q-table, Dyna-Q model (T, R) ...
        
    def _discretize_state(self, indicators_values):
        # Convert continuous indicator values to a single discrete state index
        pass

    def addEvidence(self, symbol, sd, ed, sv):
        # 1. Load price data and compute indicators
        # 2. Iterate through training data day by day:
        #    a. Determine current discretized state (s)
        #    b. Choose an action (a) using epsilon-greedy policy based on Q[s,:]
        #    c. Execute action, observe reward (r) and next state (s_prime)
        #    d. Update Q[s, a] using the Q-learning update rule:
        #       Q[s,a] = (1-alpha)*Q[s,a] + alpha*(r + gamma*max(Q[s_prime,:]))
        #    e. If Dyna-Q is enabled:
        #       i. Update transition model T(s,a) -> s_prime and reward model R(s,a) -> r
        #       ii. Perform 'dyna_iterations' of planning: randomly sample previous (s,a), predict s_prime, r from model, and update Q[s,a]
        #    f. Decay random_action_rate
        pass
        
    def testPolicy(self, symbol, sd, ed, sv):
        # 1. Load price data and compute indicators for the test period
        # 2. For each day:
        #    a. Determine current discretized state (s)
        #    b. Choose the action (a) that maximizes Q[s,:] (greedy policy)
        #    c. Convert action to trades
        # 3. Return DataFrame of trades
        pass
```

### 2. Realistic Market Simulator
Crucial for reliable strategy evaluation, the simulator models real-world trading conditions.
```python
def compute_portvals(orders_df, start_val=100000.0, commission=9.95, impact=0.005, prices_df=None):
    """
    Simulate trading with realistic costs and compute portfolio values.
    
    Parameters:
    -----------    
    orders_df : pd.DataFrame
        Trading orders (dates as index, symbols as columns, values are shares traded).
    start_val : float
        Initial portfolio cash value.
    commission : float
        Fixed commission cost per trade.
    impact : float
        Market impact (slippage) as a percentage of trade value.
    prices_df: pd.DataFrame
        DataFrame of daily prices for the traded symbols.
        
    Returns:
    --------
    pd.Series
        Daily portfolio values over time.
    """
    # Implementation details:
    # 1. Initialize portfolio: cash = start_val, holdings = 0 for all symbols.
    # 2. Iterate through dates in orders_df:
    #    For each symbol with an order on that date:
    #    a. Get current price from prices_df.
    #    b. Calculate trade value.
    #    c. Adjust cash: subtract (trade_value + commission + abs(trade_value * impact)).
    #    d. Update holdings for the symbol.
    # 3. Calculate daily total portfolio value (cash + market value of all holdings).
    pass
```

### 3. Technical Indicator Library
A comprehensive set of functions to calculate various technical indicators used for feature engineering. Example:
```python
def bollinger_indicator(prices_df, symbol, window=20, num_std=2):
    """Calculate Bollinger Bands indicator values, normalized."""
    prices = prices_df[symbol]
    rolling_mean = prices.rolling(window=window).mean()
    rolling_std = prices.rolling(window=window).std()
    
    upper_band = rolling_mean + (rolling_std * num_std)
    lower_band = rolling_mean - (rolling_std * num_std)
    
    # Normalized Bollinger value: (price - SMA) / (num_std * StdDev)
    # This value is typically between -1 and 1 if price is within bands.
    bb_value = (prices - rolling_mean) / (rolling_std * num_std)
    return pd.DataFrame(bb_value, index=prices.index, columns=['bollinger'])
```

### 4. Configuration Management
Experiments are defined using YAML files, ensuring all parameters (data sources, date ranges, strategy hyperparameters, simulation costs) are explicitly stated and versionable.
```yaml
