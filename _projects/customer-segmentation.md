## Project Overview

As a capstone project for the BCG RISE 2.0 program, I led a comprehensive data science initiative for CS Tay, a leading frozen food distributor in Singapore. This project transformed the company's commercial strategy through advanced analytics, delivering a sophisticated four-stage optimization pipeline that maximizes retail revenue through data-driven pricing strategies.

**Strategic Impact**: Our team identified a potential **SGD ~4M annual revenue uplift** through segment-specific pricing optimization, representing a breakthrough in pricing intelligence for the frozen food distribution industry.

## The Business Challenge: Navigating a Mature Market

CS Tay faced several pressing commercial challenges:
* **Stagnating Revenue Growth:** Difficulty in expanding revenue despite a substantial customer base.
* **Margin Pressure:** Increasing operational costs and competitive pricing were eroding profitability.
* **Limited Customer Insights:** An abundance of transaction data was not being effectively utilized to understand customer behavior or tailor strategies.
* **Inefficient Pricing:** Pricing decisions were primarily cost-plus, not reflecting customer willingness-to-pay or market dynamics.
* **Homogeneous Strategy:** A one-size-fits-all approach was applied across a diverse customer portfolio, limiting effectiveness.

The core objective was to transition CS Tay towards a data-informed commercial decision-making framework.

## Our Strategic Three-Phase Solution

We adopted a structured, three-phase methodology to address these challenges:

    * **Cross-Price Integration**: Sophisticated modeling of substitute/complement effects in optimization objective
    * **Scenario Analysis**: Comprehensive sensitivity testing and trade-off evaluation
* **Strategic Deliverables:**
    * **Revenue Maximization**: Mathematical formulation incorporating elasticity-driven demand response
    * **Implementation Roadmap**: Phased rollout strategy with risk mitigation and success metrics
    * **Segment-Specific Strategies**: Tailored pricing approaches aligned with customer behavior and market position
    * **Business Impact Projection**: **SGD ~4M annual revenue uplift** with primary gains from Supermarket segment optimization

## Key Learnings & Strategic Value

This capstone project demonstrated the transformative power of applying data science to core commercial strategy. Key takeaways include:

* **Business Context is Crucial:** A deep understanding of the business problem and operational realities is essential for designing effective and implementable data science solutions.
* **Integrated Approach:** Combining multiple analytical techniques (segmentation, elasticity, optimization) yields a more holistic and robust strategy than any single method alone.
* **Actionability is Paramount:** Insights must be translated into clear, actionable recommendations that the business can execute.
* **Iterative Refinement:** Data science projects in business often require an iterative approach, refining models and analyses based on initial findings and stakeholder feedback.

By embedding data-driven insights into its commercial operations, CS Tay is positioned to achieve sustainable revenue growth and enhanced profitability.
