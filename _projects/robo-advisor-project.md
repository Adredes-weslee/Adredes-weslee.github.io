## Project Overview

This project introduces an **AI-Powered Robo-Advisor** that leverages supervised machine learning for nuanced investor risk profiling and combines classical Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) with advanced Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for dynamic portfolio optimization. The system, accessible via an interactive Plotly Dash dashboard, aims to democratize sophisticated investment management by providing personalized, adaptive, and data-driven financial advice. The DRL component, specifically a Deep Q-Network (DQN), demonstrated superior risk-adjusted returns in backtests compared to traditional MPT and market benchmarks.

## The Market Need: Evolving Robo-Advisory Services

Traditional financial advisory often involves high fees and minimum investment thresholds, limiting access for many retail investors. While first-generation robo-advisors have improved accessibility, they typically suffer from:
1.  **Static and Simplistic Risk Assessment:** Reliance on rigid questionnaires that may not accurately capture an individual's true risk tolerance.
2.  **Template-Based Allocation:** Mapping users to a few predefined portfolio templates rather than offering truly individualized optimization.
3.  **Lack of Market Adaptability:** Strategies that don't dynamically adjust to evolving market conditions or an investor's changing circumstances.
4.  **Limited Personalization:** Offering a restricted set of portfolio choices.

This project addresses these gaps by creating a more intelligent, adaptive, and personalized robo-advisory solution.

## System Architecture & Workflow

The AI-Powered Robo-Advisor integrates three core components:

![System Architecture Diagram](/assets/images/robo-advisor-architecture.png)

1.  **Risk Profile Predictor (Supervised Learning):**
    * Utilizes data from the U.S. Federal Reserve's **2019 Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF)**.
    * Employs an **Extra Trees Regressor** model (selected after comparing multiple algorithms) to predict an investor's risk tolerance on a continuous 0-1 scale based on over 40 demographic, financial, and behavioral features.
    * Achieved an **RÂ² of 0.91** and **RMSE of 0.115** in predicting a synthetically derived risk score.

2.  **Portfolio Optimizer (MPT & Reinforcement Learning):**
    * Uses historical S&P 500 stock price data (2000-2023 via `yfinance`).
    * **Classical MPT Module:** Implements Markowitz optimization using `CVXOPT` to generate efficient frontier portfolios based on the predicted risk tolerance.
    * **Reinforcement Learning Module:** A **Deep Q-Network (DQN)** agent trained in a custom OpenAI Gym environment to learn optimal dynamic allocation strategies. The agent's reward function is based on maximizing the Sharpe ratio.

3.  **Interactive Dashboard & Chatbot (Plotly Dash & OpenAI):**
    * A web-based interface where users input their profile information (13 key characteristics).
    * Displays the predicted risk tolerance score.
    * Allows users to select an investment universe (e.g., specific S&P 500 stocks).
    * Presents personalized portfolio allocations from both MPT and RL optimizers, with performance backtests and visualizations.
    * Integrates an **AI-powered chatbot (using OpenAI API)** to answer user queries and provide financial explanations.

**Workflow:**
User inputs data -> Risk tolerance predicted -> Portfolio optimized (MPT & RL in parallel) -> Recommendations & chatbot support displayed.

## Key Features & Technical Innovations

### 1. Advanced Risk Profiling
-   **Data-Driven:** Leverages the comprehensive SCF dataset, moving beyond simple questionnaires.
-   **Machine Learning Powered:** The Extra Trees Regressor model captures complex relationships between user characteristics and risk-taking behavior.
-   **Nuanced Score:** Predicts risk tolerance as a continuous variable, allowing for finer-grained personalization.
-   **Key Predictive Features:** Age, income stability, self-assessed financial knowledge, existing asset allocations, and investment time horizon were found to be most influential.

### 2. Dual Portfolio Optimization Engine
-   **Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT):** Provides a theoretically grounded, mean-variance optimized portfolio as a baseline. Implemented using `cvxopt` for convex optimization.
    ```python
    # Conceptual MPT snippet (from blog post)
    # def markowitz_optimization(returns, risk_tolerance=0.5):
    #     # ... calculates mean returns, covariance ...
    #     # ... sets up CVXOPT QP problem ...
    #     # optimal_weights = solvers.qp(...)['x']
    #     return np.array(optimal_weights).flatten()
    ```
-   **Deep Q-Network (DQN) for Dynamic Allocation:**
    -   **Adaptive Learning:** The RL agent learns to make allocation decisions by interacting with a simulated market environment based on historical S&P 500 data.
    -   **Custom Environment:** A `PortfolioEnv` (OpenAI Gym custom environment) where states include historical returns and current allocations, and actions are discrete portfolio weight adjustments.
    -   **Reward Mechanism:** The agent is rewarded based on the Sharpe ratio of its portfolio, encouraging optimal risk-adjusted returns.
    -   **Neural Network Architecture:** A Keras-based neural network approximates the Q-function.
    ```python
    # Conceptual DQN Agent Structure (from blog post)
    # class PortfolioEnv(gym.Env): # ... defines states, actions, rewards ...
    # def build_dqn_agent(env): # ... Keras model, DQNAgent from rl.agents ...
    # dqn.fit(env, nb_steps=100000) # Training the agent
    ```

### 3. Interactive and Personalized User Experience
-   **User-Friendly Interface:** Built with Plotly Dash for intuitive data input and visualization.
-   **Personalized Recommendations:** Portfolio allocations are directly tied to the ML-predicted risk score.
-   **Comparative Analysis:** Users can see and compare portfolios generated by MPT and the RL agent.
-   **AI Chatbot Support:** An integrated OpenAI chatbot provides contextual financial explanations and answers user questions, enhancing financial literacy.

## Performance Highlights & Business Impact

Backtesting (focused on 2020-2023, including market volatility) demonstrated the RL agent's potential:

| Strategy (Example: High Risk Profile) | Annualized Return | Max Drawdown | Sharpe Ratio | Sortino Ratio |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------ | ------------ | ------------- |
| **RL Portfolio (DQN)** | **17.2%** | **-19.3%** | **1.75** | **2.31** |
| MPT Portfolio                         | 15.8%             | -22.6%       | 1.42         | 1.95          |
| S&P 500 Benchmark                     | 10.2%             | -33.9%       | 0.95         | 1.27          |

*Note: Performance figures are illustrative based on specific backtest conditions detailed in the project.*

**Key Advantages Demonstrated:**
-   **Improved Risk-Adjusted Returns:** The DQN approach generally yielded higher Sharpe and Sortino ratios.
-   **Better Downside Protection:** RL portfolios exhibited lower maximum drawdowns during periods of market stress (e.g., COVID-19 crash).
-   **Adaptive Strategy:** The RL agent demonstrated an ability to adjust allocations more dynamically in response to changing market conditions compared to static MPT.
-   **Enhanced Personalization:** The system moves beyond a few risk buckets to offer a continuous spectrum of portfolio adjustments based on the precise predicted risk score.

This AI-powered robo-advisor offers the potential to:
-   Democratize access to sophisticated, personalized investment advice.
-   Improve financial outcomes for retail investors through more adaptive strategies.
-   Provide financial institutions with a more advanced tool for client advisory.
