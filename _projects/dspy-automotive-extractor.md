## The Business Challenge: Unstructured Data at Scale

### Problem Statement

Automotive manufacturers, service centers, and regulatory bodies process **millions of unstructured complaint documents** annually. The NHTSA alone receives over 100,000 automotive complaints yearly, containing critical safety and quality information buried in free-form text narratives.

**Traditional approaches fail because:**
- Manual extraction is expensive and error-prone
- Rule-based systems can't handle natural language variation
- Generic AI solutions lack automotive domain expertise
- Cloud APIs create security and compliance concerns

### The Hidden Cost of Manual Processing

```
Manual Processing Reality:
‚Ä¢ 40 hours/week √ó $50/hour = $2,000/week per analyst
‚Ä¢ 70% accuracy rate ‚Üí 30% rework requirement
‚Ä¢ 6-month training period for domain expertise
‚Ä¢ No systematic improvement methodology

DSPy Automated Approach:
‚Ä¢ 15 minutes setup √ó $100/hour = $25 one-time cost
‚Ä¢ 51.33% accuracy with systematic optimization
‚Ä¢ Zero training period for deployment
‚Ä¢ Continuous improvement through experimental validation
```
