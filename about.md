# About Me: Wes Lee

Hello! I'm Wes Lee, an AI Engineer passionate about transforming complex challenges into scalable, intelligent solutions. My journey into AI is driven by a fascination with machine learning's potential and a background that blends education, strategic consulting, and a proven ability to deliver impactful results.

Currently, I'm immersed in the AI Apprenticeship Programme (AIAP) at AI Singapore, a prestigious initiative shaping the next wave of AI talent. Here, I'm contributing to a production-grade LLM-powered information extraction engine for Visier, a global HR analytics leader. This involves fine-tuning models like LLaMA 3.1, building robust DSPy pipelines, and developing custom evaluation frameworks. My capstone project was an enterprise-grade RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system, a secure, containerized solution for querying diverse documents using self-hosted LLMs.

Before diving deep into AI, I honed my analytical and leadership skills in different arenas. As Head Chemistry Tutor at Ideas Ink School, I led the department to significant growth, scaling operations to 7-figure annual revenues and mentoring hundreds of students to academic success. More recently, as a Consultant at TalentKraft, I contributed to strategic human capital projects, including redesigning digital platforms and automating reporting workflows with Google Apps Script. These experiences have been invaluable in developing strong stakeholder engagement, business storytelling, and problem-solving capabilities that I now apply to AI.

## My AI Focus & Expertise

My core technical focus lies in:

**Applied Machine Learning & NLP**: Specializing in Large Language Models (LLMs) â€“ including fine-tuning (LLaMA 3.1, DeBERTa, Phi-3), RAG systems, prompt engineering, and frameworks like DSPy, LangChain, and HuggingFace Transformers.

**Full-Stack AI Systems**: Developing end-to-end solutions, from data ingestion and model development to building APIs (FastAPI) and interactive UIs (Streamlit, Dash).

**MLOps & Production Deployment**: Proficient in Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD (GitLab), MLflow for experiment tracking, and deploying models on cloud platforms (GCP, AWS).

**Data Science & Analytics**: Leveraging Python, SQL, and various libraries for data manipulation, visualization, supervised/unsupervised learning, and time series analysis.

I'm continuously learning and expanding my skillset, currently pursuing a Master of Science in Analytics from Georgia Institute of Technology (4.0 GPA). I've also completed specialized training through the BCG RISE 2.0 (Data Analyst Track) and the General Assembly Data Science Immersive.
