Below are some of my key projects in AI, machine learning, and data science. Each project demonstrates different aspects of my technical skills and problem-solving approach.

## LLM & NLP Projects

These projects showcase my work with large language models, transformer architectures, and natural language processing:

* [**NLP Earnings Report Analyzer**](/projects/nlp-earnings-analyzer/) - Financial text analysis combining traditional NLP and transformer models for earnings reports
* [**Custom RAG Engine for Enterprise Document QA**](/projects/rag-engine-project/) - Containerized document QA system with hybrid embedding models and self-hosted inference
* [**YouTube Comment Sentiment Analysis: Unlocking Audience Insights for Content Creators**](/projects/sentiment-analysis/) - Hybrid labeling system combining rule-based and transformer approaches

## Machine Learning & AI Applications

Projects demonstrating various ML techniques and domain applications:

* [**ML Trading Strategist**](/projects/ml-trading-strategist/) - Algorithmic trading framework comparing rule-based, tree-ensemble, and reinforcement learning approaches
* [**Intelligent Investing: An AI-Powered Robo-Advisor for Personalized Portfolio Management**](/projects/robo-advisor-project/) - Portfolio optimization using reinforcement learning and risk profiling
* [**Building an HDB Resale Price Predictor: A Technical Deep Dive into Feature Engineering and Regression**](/projects/hdb-resale-prices/) - Advanced regression modeling for Singapore's housing market
* [**Wet-Bulb Temperature & Climate Resilience: A Policy-Focused Data Study for Singapore**](/projects/wet-bulb-temperature/) - Climate data modeling for heat stress prediction

## Data Science & Business Analytics

Projects focused on extracting insights and delivering business value:

* [**Strategic Growth Engine: Data-Driven Customer Segmentation & Price Optimization for CS Tay**](/projects/customer-segmentation/) - RFM analysis and revenue optimization for frozen food distributor
* [**Strategic Dengue Control: Forecasting & Cost-Benefit Analysis for Public Health Interventions in Singapore**](/projects/dengue-forecasting/) - Time series analysis with health intervention cost-benefit analysis

## Technical Skills Demonstrated

* **Machine Learning:** Classification, regression, clustering, time series forecasting, deep learning
* **NLP & LLMs:** RAG systems, prompt tuning/optimization, fine-tuning, embedding techniques, sentiment analysis
* **MLOps:** Docker, Kubernetes, MLflow, observability, deployment pipelines
* **Data Analysis:** Feature engineering, statistical modeling, visualization
* **Business Impact:** Cost-benefit analysis, revenue optimization, actionable insights

## Project Methodology

All projects follow a structured development approach:

1. **Problem Definition** - Clear objectives and success metrics
2. **Data Collection & Processing** - Rigorous cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering
3. **Model Development** - Iterative training, validation, and hyperparameter tuning
4. **Evaluation** - Comprehensive testing using appropriate metrics
5. **Deployment & Documentation** - Production-ready code with clear documentation
