Below are some of my key projects in AI, machine learning, and data science. Each project demonstrates different aspects of my technical skills and problem-solving approach.

## LLM & NLP Projects

These projects showcase my work with large language models, transformer architectures, and natural language processing:

* [**NLP Earnings Report Analyzer**](/projects/nlp-earnings-analyzer/) - Financial text analysis combining traditional NLP and transformer models for earnings reports
* [**Custom RAG Engine for Enterprise Document QA**](/projects/rag-engine-project/) - Containerized document QA system with hybrid embedding models and self-hosted inference
* [**Sentiment Analysis of YouTube Comments**](/projects/sentiment-analysis/) - Hybrid labeling system combining rule-based and transformer approaches

## Machine Learning & AI Applications

Projects demonstrating various ML techniques and domain applications:

* [**ML Trading Strategist**](/projects/ml-trading-strategist/) - Algorithmic trading framework comparing rule-based, tree-ensemble, and reinforcement learning approaches
* [**AI-Powered Robo Advisor**](/projects/robo-advisor-project/) - Portfolio optimization using reinforcement learning and risk profiling
* [**HDB Resale Price Prediction**](/projects/hdb-resale-prices/) - Advanced regression modeling for Singapore's housing market
* [**Wet-Bulb Temperature Analysis**](/projects/wet-bulb-temperature/) - Climate data modeling for heat stress prediction

## Data Science & Business Analytics

Projects focused on extracting insights and delivering business value:
